  <h1>Early Brewing</h1>
  <p>Major ecological changes around 12000 BCE, including melting glaciers and the flourishing of vegetation, set the stage for the evolution of beer. However, it wasn't until after 10000 BCE that beer became widespread, with documentation emerging in the Fertile Crescent, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. Barley's natural proliferation resulted in settled communities, prompting the transition from foraging to agriculture and permanent housing.  Barley was challenging to consume due to it’s hardness and indigestibility, and had to go through the malting process. The malting process involves sprouting, germination, and drying This malting process made barley more digestible and laid the foundation for both bread and beer production. The Sumerians were the first civilized culture to brew beer. The Babylonians, succeeding the Sumerians, inherited the brewing tradition and established laws related to beer consumption, including daily rationing based on social standing. Meanwhile, the Egyptians regarded it as a god-given drink that supported their existence. Both Mesopotamians and Egyptians used beer medicinally, and the Egyptians added fruit and spices to their brews. The rich history of beer highlights its significance as a cultural and social phenomenons</p>
  <h4>Timeline:</h4> 
  <p>12000 BCE, End of the last Ice Age</p> 
  <p>4300 BCE, Babylonian clay tablets detail recipes for beer</p> 
  <p>1600 BCE, Egyptian texts contain 100 medical prescriptions calling for beer</p>
  <p>55 BCE, Roman legions introduce beer to Northern Europe</p>
 
  <h1>Middle Ages</h1>
  <p> During the Middle Ages, the brewing practice experienced a great transformation. The Greeks and Romans generally drank wine as opposed to beer. In the absence of grapevines, beer brewing found a new home in Europe and the British Isles, often by the hands of alewives, women who not only crafted beer but also ran taverns. The Middle Ages witnessed a shift from familial brewing to centralized production in monasteries and convents between 500 and 1000 AD. Monastic brewers became the first scientific students of beer production, elevating it from an art to a science. Around 800 AD, they introduced hops for flavoring, introducing bitterness and standardized flavors. The use of hops, despite facing resistance in some regions to protect local interests, eventually prevailed due to its benefits in stabilizing beer, increasing its shelf life, and eliminating folktale (beer witches) for subpar brews. The German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot), originating in Bavaria in 1516, became the first beer guild, mandating the use of only barley, hops, and pure water for beer production, although yeast was later acknowledged. This law aimed to maintain quality and consistency, setting a standard that still influences brewing practices today./p>
  <h4>Timeline:</h4> 
  <p>500-1000 AD the first half of the Middle Ages, brewing begins to be practiced in Europe, shifting from family tradition to centralized production in monasteries and convents</p> 
  <p>1000 AD, hops begins to be used in the brewing process</p> 
  <p>1200 AD, beer making is firmly established as a commercial enterprise in Germany, Austria, and England</p>
  <p>Late 1500's AD,  Queen Elizabeth I of England drank strong ale for breakfast</p>
  <p> 1620 AD, Pilgrims land at Plymouth Rock because the beer supplies were running low</p>

  <h1>Industrializing Brewing</h1>
<p>The production of beer faced significant challenges due to the specific temperature requirements for brewing a good brew. Traditionally, brewing was limited to the months between September and April or May, avoiding the warmth of late spring and summer. Two inventions revolutionized beer production. The first was the steam engine, introduced by James Watt in 1765. This innovation increased efficiency by aiding in the heating of ingredients, pumping, and grain milling. The second invention was refrigeration, led by Carl von Linde in 1895, with some initial research supported by Guinness. Refrigeration enabled the cooling of wort, the aeration of wort, and the production of lager, a bottom-fermenting beer requiring cold temperatures (4-10°C). Prior to refrigeration, brewers relied on root cellars with ice blocks or winter months for cold storage. The introduction of refrigeration allowed for year-round production of high-quality lager beer, with the first equipment implemented in a Munich brewery. Additionally, key developments by scientists like Louis Pasteur in the 1860s, who addressed unsanitary conditions and pioneered pasteurization, and Danish scientist Christian Hansen, the first to isolate yeast on a solid medium, further elevated beer production. These innovations collectively contributed to overcoming historical limitations and advancing the brewing industry into a new era of year-round, high-quality production.</p>

<h4>Timeline:</h4> 
<p>1765 AD, James Watt's steam engine inventions increased efficiency of beer production</p> 
  <p>1810 AD, Munich establishes Oktoberfest as an official celebration</p> 
  <p>1860s AD, Louis Pasteur introduces pasteurization</p>
  <p>1880 AD, there are approximately 2,300 breweries in the US</p>
  <p>1895 AD, With Carl von Linde's refrigeration, came year round production of high quality lager beer</p>

  <h1>Modern American Brewing</h1>
  <p>The Prohibitionist Movement, gaining momentum in the 1840s with the Washingtonians Movement and the Temperance Movement, sought to limit alcohol consumption. Initially led by reformed drunks supporting each other's sobriety, the movement evolved with male-dominated temperance organizations and a women's-only movement initiated by Susan B Anthony. By 1907, Oklahoma became the first "dry" state, and the temperance wave intensified, with nine states going dry by 1913. The anti-German sentiment during World War I assisted the  prohibitionists, as Germans were predominantly associated with beer making. The Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and the Anti-Saloon League (ASL) capitalized on the wartime atmosphere, pushing for the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Volstead Act was then enacted in 1919. However, the Prohibition era proved to be a failed social experiment, due to widespread corruption, hypocrisy, and the rise of organized crime. The 21st Amendment, passed on December 5, 1933, repealed Prohibition, allowing the beer to flow once again. However, the aftermath brought about new challenges, with the imposition of drinking age limits, alcohol content restrictions, and the rise of less flavorful, lower-alcohol beer to meet changing demands during the Great Depression. The craft beer renaissance in the 1980s and a rapid increase in craft breweries in 2009 signaled a renewed appreciation for diverse and flavorful beer options. Today, with over 140 breweries and brewpubs in Maine alone, the brewing landscape has evolved into a vibrant and diverse industry.</p>
